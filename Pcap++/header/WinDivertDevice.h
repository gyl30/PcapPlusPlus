	/// and provides methods to receive and send packets in batches, query/set queue parameters,
	/// retrieve the WinDivert runtime version, and enumerate Windows network interfaces.
	///
	/// Notes:
	/// - The default open() uses the filter "inbound or outbound", capturing both directions.
	/// - The device is opened in sniffing mode and supports fragmented packets.
	/// - Receive can be done into a user-provided vector or via a callback loop that can be stopped with stopReceive().
	/// - Send batches multiple packets at once for efficiency.
	/// - Queue parameters map to WinDivert queue configuration (length in packets, time in milliseconds, size in
	/// bytes).
	///
	/// For WinDivert filter syntax, layer semantics, timestamps and error codes please refer to the WinDivert
	/// documentation.
